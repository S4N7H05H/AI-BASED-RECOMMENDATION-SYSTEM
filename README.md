# Description

This task focuses on building an AI-based Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering in Java. The objective is to recommend movies to users based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes, demonstrating how basic machine learning logic can be implemented without external frameworks.

The system uses a sample dataset of users and their movie ratings, stored in nested maps (Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Double>>). The program prompts the current user to rate a list of movies, then calculates similarity scores between the user and existing users using the Euclidean Distance metric. The user with the smallest distance is identified as the most similar user.

Based on this similarity, the system recommends an unseen, highly-rated movie from the similar user’s ratings, displaying both the recommendation and the predicted rating.

This project strengthens understanding of data structures, mathematical similarity computation, and AI-driven decision-making. It highlights how simple logic can power intelligent recommendation systems like those used in Netflix, YouTube, or Spotify — forming a foundational step toward mastering data science and machine learning concepts in Java.
